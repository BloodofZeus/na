# Overview

Shawarma Boss POS is a modern Point of Sale system built with the MERN stack (MongoDB/PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, Node.js). Originally developed as a vanilla JavaScript PWA stored in localStorage, it has been transformed into a full-stack application with a React frontend, Express.js backend, and PostgreSQL database. The system provides comprehensive POS functionality including user authentication, menu management, order processing, receipt generation, sales tracking, and real-time inventory management with role-based access control for admin and staff users.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **React 18** with functional components and hooks for the user interface
- **React Router** for client-side navigation between POS and admin views
- **Context API** for state management (AuthContext for user sessions, CartContext for shopping cart)
- **Axios** for HTTP client communication with the backend API
- **Component-based architecture** with reusable components (Header, Login, POS, Admin, Cart, MenuGrid, OrderModal)
- **Responsive design** using Bootstrap 5 and custom CSS with mobile-first approach
- **Webpack** for module bundling and build process with hot reloading in development

## Backend Architecture
- **Express.js** web server providing RESTful API endpoints
- **PostgreSQL** as the primary database with ACID compliance
- **Database initialization** with automatic table creation and default data seeding
- **Role-based authentication** with admin and staff user roles
- **CORS enabled** for cross-origin requests (required for Replit proxy)
- **Environment variable configuration** for database connection and deployment flexibility
- **Static file serving** for both React build artifacts and legacy PWA assets

## Data Storage Architecture
- **PostgreSQL tables**: users, menu, orders with proper relational structure
- **Backward compatibility** with localStorage data migration for existing installations
- **JSON metadata storage** in JSONB fields for flexible data extension
- **Automatic timestamp tracking** for created_at and updated_at fields

## Authentication & Authorization
- **Session-based authentication** with localStorage persistence
- **Role-based access control** (admin can access all features, staff limited to POS functionality)
- **Token-based API authentication** for external server sync (optional)
- **Password validation** with secure credential handling

## Legacy PWA Support
- **Service worker** for offline functionality and caching
- **Web app manifest** for PWA installation capabilities
- **Progressive enhancement** approach maintaining offline-first functionality
- **Dual architecture** supporting both modern React app and legacy vanilla JavaScript

# Replit Environment Setup (October 2025)

## Development Configuration
- **Frontend**: Webpack dev server on port 5000 (0.0.0.0) with proxy to backend
- **Backend**: Express.js server on port 3001 (localhost)
- **Database**: Replit-managed PostgreSQL database
- **Workflow**: Single "Full Stack Server" workflow runs both frontend and backend using concurrently

## Environment Variables (Auto-configured by Replit)
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, `PGUSER`, `PGPASSWORD`, `PGDATABASE` - Database credentials

## Database Initialization
- Run POST request to `/api/init-db` to create tables and seed default data
- Default users: admin/admin123 (admin role), staff1/staff123 (staff role)
- Creates tables: users, menu, orders with proper indexes

## Production Deployment
- Build command: `npm run build` (creates optimized bundle in /dist)
- Run command: `node server.js` (serves static files and API)
- Deployment target: Autoscale (stateless application)

# Recent Changes

## GitHub Import Setup (October 2, 2025)
- Successfully imported Shawarma Boss POS from GitHub to Replit
- Created and configured PostgreSQL database with Replit's managed database service
- Initialized database with default users (admin/admin123, staff1/staff123) and menu items
- Configured Full Stack Server workflow to run both frontend (port 5000) and backend (port 3001)
- Set up deployment configuration for production (autoscale with build and run commands)
- Verified all API endpoints are working correctly
- Frontend is properly configured with allowedHosts: 'all' for Replit's proxy environment

## Bug Fixes (October 2, 2025)
- **Staff Deletion Foreign Key Fix**: Fixed staff deletion error by nullifying orders.staff field before deleting users. This prevents foreign key constraint violations when deleting staff members who have associated orders.
- **Login Error Messages**: Improved login error handling with user-friendly messages ("Invalid username or password" instead of generic errors). Added toast notifications for login success and failure with clear feedback.
- **Login Success Notification**: Added welcome toast notification when users successfully log in, showing "Welcome back, [username]!"
